[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kaustavbhattacharjee/mini_project_3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kaustavbhattacharjee/mini_project_3)

## Project Description

This project is about uploading the API created as a part of the previous homework to Heroku and implement continuous testing. This homework is a part of the class IS 601 of Fall 2019.

## Problem Statement
For this assignment you need to follow this tutorial to create the application.

[https://www.codementor.io/olawalealadeusi896/building-a-restful-blog-apis-using-python-and-flask-part-3-lx7rt8pfk](https://www.codementor.io/olawalealadeusi896/building-a-restful-blog-apis-using-python-and-flask-part-3-lx7rt8pfk) 

Upload it to Github and submit a link to the repo branch called "part3" and provide a link to the app running Heroku.

## Output

I have uploaded the API to heroku and also setup continuous testing, along with Travis CI.

### TESTING:

I have checked that the API passed all the test cases designed for it. Below is a screenshot of the 11 tests being successfully passed:

I would also like to point out that this project is also integrated with **Travis CI**.

### HOSTING ON HEROKU:

The objective of this section is to host the app on Heroku. The app is hosted at the following URL:

[https://blogapi-tutorial-kb.herokuapp.com/](https://blogapi-tutorial-kb.herokuapp.com/)

This image shows that the app is responding on the default endpoint, at Heroku:

I have also tested different API calls and all of them are running successfully on the Heroku app. Below is a screenshot of all the blogposts being successfully retrieved:
